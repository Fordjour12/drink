   ✔ [ ] Show a progress bar to visualize progress toward the daily goal. @done(24-11-02 02:27)
   ✔ [ ] Add a button to log a fixed amount of water intake (250 ml increments). @done(24-11-02 02:27)
   ✔ [ ] Save each water log entry in AsyncStorage for persistence. @done(24-11-02 02:27)

3. Notifications - Reminders:
   ✔ [ ] Implement notifications to remind the user to drink water every 2 hours. @done(24-11-02 12:44)
   ✔ [ ] Customize notifications to be scheduled using `React Native Push Notification`. @done(24-11-02 12:44)

4. Data Persistence:
   - [ ] Use AsyncStorage to save and retrieve water intake data and daily goals.
   ✔ [ ] Reset the water intake log at midnight to start a fresh count daily. @done(24-11-02 13:06)

5. Stats Screen (Optional Enhancement):
   ✔ [ ] Display a simple history of the last few days' water intake. @done(24-11-02 13:06)
   ✔ [ ] Calculate streaks or achievements for hitting daily goals consistently. @done(24-11-02 13:06)


  Steps:

Step 1: Project Setup:
- [ ] Initialize a new React Native project: `npx react-native init WaterTracker`.
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
  npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
  npm install react-native-push-notification
  ```

Step 2: Build the Home Screen:
- [ ] Create a `HomeScreen.js` component under `components/`.
- [ ] Add UI elements to display:
  - [ ] Total water intake for the day.
  - [ ] Progress bar that updates based on water intake.
  - [ ] Button to add 250 ml increments of water intake.
- [ ] Implement functions to:
  - [ ] Increase water intake when the button is clicked.
  - [ ] Save updated water intake data to AsyncStorage.

Step 3: Set Up Notifications:
- [ ] Create a `notifications.js` file in the `services/` folder.
- [ ] Use `React Native Push Notification` to set up reminders.
- [ ] Implement a notification schedule to remind the user every 2 hours to drink water.
- [ ] Test notifications to confirm functionality.

Step 4: Add Data Persistence with AsyncStorage:
- [ ] Create utility functions in a `storage.js` file under `utils/`:
  - [ ] `saveWaterIntake(amount)`: Save the updated intake value to AsyncStorage.
  - [ ] `getWaterIntake()`: Retrieve the current intake value from AsyncStorage.
- [ ] Update the `HomeScreen` component to use these functions to load and save water intake data.

Step 5: Reset Water Intake at Midnight:
- [ ] Add logic to reset water intake data at midnight.
- [ ] For MVP, use a simple manual reset button (optional for day 1).

Step 6: Testing and Finishing Touches:
- [ ] Test the app to ensure:
  - [ ] Water intake logging works as expected.
  - [ ] The progress bar updates correctly based on the intake.
  - [ ] Notifications are scheduled and displayed every 2 hours.
  - [ ] Data persists and reloads accurately after closing and reopening the app.
- [ ] Address any bugs or UI tweaks.

Future Enhancements (For Later Phases):
- [ ] Add a settings screen to set custom daily goals.
- [ ] Track weekly and monthly water intake stats.
- [ ] Implement more flexible notification scheduling.
- [ ] Integrate with fitness or health apps.
